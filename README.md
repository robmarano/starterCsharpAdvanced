Starter app for learning basic and advanced C# development

Module 7

Class,

We will do the following real-time chat system using ASP.NET MVC5 and
the new SignalR .NET library for real-time communications.

I will make that module 7 in our github.

Let me know how you do! This is the basis of a very good application.
Also, you can learn to put authentication on it too using this tutorial:
